# Life
Windows Forms C# based algoritm, which dewelops "life".

I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/qzFlnX-z38U">stream</a> of <b>The Codin Train</b> it inspired me! I want to create something simillar. 
For this taks I'll use Microsoft Visual C# ant their Visual Studio. I'm begginer at coding and genetic algorithms, so don't expect something amusing :)
